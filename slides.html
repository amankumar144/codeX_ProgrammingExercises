* Not an academic approach

* A way to get going

# What is a computer program?

# What is a computer program?

  * Takes input
  * Process it 
  * Give some output

List of instructions that when executed, achieve a certain task.

How the instructions are triggered can vary…
  
---

# How does a computer program...

* remember stuff?

* know stuff?

* decide what to do?

* get stuff done?

* give feedback?

---

class: center, middle

#Computer Programs remember and know stuff using input stored in variables

---



# Variables
* Like buckets 

## Like a labelled shelf

* The shelf is not the product?

* Different types

* Place holders of information

* Point to information

* Scope - what variables are visible when?

---

#Variables types

##Can be simple

Hold one variable : number/string/boolean

Variables can be objects - so we can ask them questions

* What is your length
* Give me a part of you - substring

## Complex
* Data structures
* Hold multiple values : List or Map

---

# Variables can hold behaviour and state -> knows what to do
  * Object Orientation : behaviour and state
  * Functional : Immutable state & behaviour can be passed around

## Persistence

Variables stored for later use
  * Files
  * Databases - SQL / NoSQL
  * Localstorage - Javascript

---
# The journey of variables

# The journey of variables

* Variables are taken as input

* Variables are evaluated...

* Variables are given as output

#Computer programs get stuff done by applying logic on variables

---

#Computer programs get stuff done by applying logic on variables

* Variables are inspected

* Logic applied

* Arithmetic calculation

* Conditional statements

* Loops

* Task achieved…?

## ... can be synchronous or asynchronous

* Synchronous - one after the other

* Asynchronous - happens when it happens - no predictions

---

# Conditional statements

Do or don’t do something if a condition is true or false?

---

# Loops

* Do something or don’t do something until a condition is true or false?

* Blocking - don’t do anything until…

* Callback - do something when

---

# Function - Decisions/Logic grouped together

* Giving code a name

* It takes input

* May return output

# How to do in Javascript?

#Variable declaration

```javascript

var username = “andre.vermeulen”;
var age = 38;
var jogger = true;

console.log(username);
console.log(age);

var today = Date.getDate();

// Functions / objects
// object literal

var person = {
  username : “andre.vermeulen”,
  age : 38,
  birthDay : new Date(13, 1, 1976),
};

console.log(person.username);

var Person = function(username, age, birthDay) {
  this.username = age;
  this.age = age;
  this.birthDay = birthDay;
};

var person = new Person(“andre.vermeulen”, 38, new Date(13, 1, 1976));
console.log(person.username);

```

---

# Logic

```javascript
if (person.birthDay === Date.getDate()){
  person.age += 1;
}
```

# Loops :

```javascript

for(var i = 0; i < person.username.length; i++){
  var letter = person.username[i];
  if (letter !== “.”)
    console.log(letter);
}

// using while

var counter = 0;
while(counter < person.username.length){
  var letter = person.username[counter];
  if (letter !== “.”)
    console.log(letter);
  counter = counter + 1;
}


```

---

#Functions in Javascript:

```javascript

var getLetters = function(thePerson){
  var letters = [];
  for(var i = 0; i < thePerson.username.length; i++){
      var letter = thePerson.username[i];
      if (letter !== “.”)
        letters.push(letter)
  }
  return letters;
} 

// calling a function
var lettersList = getLetters(person);

```

---

# Function scope

```javascript

var PersonFinder = function(){
  // only visible in the function here
  var names = [];
  this.peopleNames =  function(){
    return names;
  }

  this.addPerson = function(person){
    names.push(person);
  }
};

// execute it like this...
var personFinder = new PersonFinder();

console.log(personFinder.peopleNames());

```

Don’t do this:

```javascript
var personFinder = PersonFinder();
```

this will be linked to the global scope…

---

# TDD

##Test Driven Development

* Way of testing what the program needs to do

* Test harness to execute logic written using a Unit Test

* Publish ones assumptions

## Test Harnesses:
  * QUnit - xUnit => JUnit, NUnit etc 
  * Mocha - Javascript alternative
  * Easy to see failing tests etc

---

# Continuous Integration

Allow a team to work together more effectively

Continuously integrating code into a central shared code repository
Unit tests for the program is executed whenever the central shared code repository changed.

## Using CI tool
  * Check out the code
  * Execute the tests
  * Some test runner of sorts
    * Gulp / Grunt
  * Report failures
    * Jenkins
    * Travis

#Let’s give it ago!

Go and clone:

https://github.com/codex-academy/codeX_ProgrammingExercises

# Get failing tests

## Fix them

## Repeat...

#What is a computer program?

### How does a computer program

* remember stuff? 
* know stuff? 
* decide what to do? 
* get stuff done? 
* give feedback?

---

# What comes to mind?

---


# I hope...

* Variables
* Logic & Conditional Statement
* Loops
* Functions

* Doing all of that in Javascript

### TDD
### Continuous Integration  
### We tried it out
