Using the Word Utility that you developed in [Exercise One](../ExerciseOne/README.md) create a web page where a user can add a sentence in a textarea. 

Once the user added the sentence display:
 
	* the number of words in the sentence
	* the longest word
	* the shortest word

##Then do at least one of the following:

###Word cloud

Create a wordcloud (think tagcloud) of the given sentence:

	* using the letter count the words start with. 
	* words that starts with the letter that occurs the most should be the biggest
	* words starting with the letter that occurs least should be the smallest.
	* do the same for the words with the same length

###Word select 

Display all the words in the sentence and allows a user to display:

	* only the words that start with selected letters. 
	* only the words that end in selected letters.
	* words of the selected length
	* words longer than the selected length
	* words shorter than the selected length
